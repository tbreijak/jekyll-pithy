I’m not sure what use this post will be to anyone else, since I wasn’t in class last week and I don’t have much to say about the coding that went on. Like I said last week, I went to Monday’s “open coding” session and was lucky enough to participate in an improvised lesson with Adina in which Scott went over the lesson plan he had sketched out for Thursday. I was still behind on my dailies, but I tried to follow along and took some pictures of the sketches that he drew out on the whiteboard.

I have spent most of this week mainlining Daniel Shiffman videos and, like Joe said last week, reviewing the videos is incredibly helpful. While I’m not really comfortable with new material as it’s presented, I’m increasingly confident with the things we were supposed to have learned weeks ago. I’m hoping this will help me going forward.

I’ve (usually with, in Diana’s [and Ringo’s] words) gotten by with a little help from my friends, but still, looking at a blank Atom page induces a panic attack. The more times I go over the earliest, most elementary stuff, the more comfortable I become with it, and that gives me confidence that I can somehow wrap my head around the more recent stuff. At the risk of sounding smug, I’m feeling pretty good about working with arrays, even though we were supposed to have had arrays down like, three weeks ago.

Anyway, I don’t know what else (else if) I can do but keep trudging along and hoping to get through this class with a passing grade.
Well, that and post this blog entry, drink some whiskey, and go to bed.
