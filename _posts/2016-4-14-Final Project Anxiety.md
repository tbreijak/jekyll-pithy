Title: Final Project Anxiety

This week I’ve been thinking (and worrying) a lot about my final project. Like everyone else, I really enjoyed everyone’s Makey Makey projects, but I don’t know whether I want to make my final project Makey-centric. The Makey is fine as a toy, I think, but its capabilities (or, probably, my imagination) is just too limited.
What I would like to do is stick with Jonathan Sterne. I’m expecting his book, *MP3: The Meaning of a Format (Sign, Storage, Transmission)*, to come in the mail today. Hopefully I can get some ideas. I’m still liking the idea of compression, and I like Nathaniel’s idea about whatever the opposite of that is, but I’m not sure what to do with it. 
Another obstacle is that I want to tie this all in with my concentration, which is early modern English lit & culture. In my meeting with Scott the other day we talked about it for a bit, and he downloaded the full text of *Hamlet*, compressed it, and then opened it in Atom. It was really cool, and only a fraction of the size. Still, though—that does not an entire final project make.
As inept a programmer as I am, I was also thinking about maybe using P5.js in some way. I also don’t know what that would look like, either, especially in the face of early modern English communication. I suppose I should look into some history of the book stuff and maybe think about the transition from oral to print culture. But this is just me brainstorming in a blog posts.
Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions, I’m all ears. I’m lookin’ at you Courtney and David.
