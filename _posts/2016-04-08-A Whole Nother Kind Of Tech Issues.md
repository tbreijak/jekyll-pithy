I really thought I was ahead of the curve this week, deciding to work with compression right out of the gate. As Aiden mentioned in his [blog](adenj86.github.io), though, it turned out to be more challenging to actually *do* something with it. While not nearly as frustrating as JavaScript, working with several very complicated audio programs and trying to accomplish something about which I have only a tenuous understanding at best, proved to be pretty goddamn frustrating.

Reading [Diana](dianarosenberger.github.io)’s blog, I’m pleased to report that I wasn’t the only one to run into some technical difficulties this week. I may have to enlist the [wizard](davidlnowak.github.io/) in my quest to make the Makey Makey control the <alt> key.

Unfortunately, Aiden and I were ultimately unsuccessful in compressing our sound files down to unintelligibility. I thought it was really cool that we were able at least to *hear* the compression as it was happening, but that wasn’t our goal. Scott mentioned that many programs have a built-in threshold that only lets the user compress things so far, and he suggested compressing the file, saving it as a bigger file, and then compressing it again. I thought I was doing that, but I couldn’t hear any difference. So, either I wasn’t doing what I thought I was doing or else I just have to do it several hundred more times.

[Nathaniel](nattybee.github.io/) suggested *de* compressing a file to kind of “blow it up,” as it were. That sounds like a really interesting thing to try, and I’m going to look into it this week. Hopefully I can somehow incorporate into my as-of-yet-undetermined final project. I think I’d like to try doing something with a video file, but I’m afraid to open yet another can of worms that I won’t know how to handle.
