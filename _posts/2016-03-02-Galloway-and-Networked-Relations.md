It seems like Haraway's master and servant metaphor still has some traction for many of us, and some people, including [Kelly](kellypolasek.github.io/) and [Hassan](hassana85.github.io/) are talking about Galloway in the context of control this week. I’m thinking along similar lines and, after reading [Noah’s](noahmcmlln.github.io/) comments about [Blas’s “Fag Face” mask]( vimeo.com/57882032), I’m thinking about intersections of power/control and anonymity in Galloway “Networks” chapter. Galloway informs us that:

>biodirectionality is not the saving grace it was once thought to be, due to the incorporation of bi- and multidirectionality into the networked technologies of control and organization. Today, interactivity means total participation, universal capture. The chain of triumph is not a monologue but a multilogue.

This is something that we’ve touched on in class discussions. Institutions (can something like Facebook be an institution?) no longer have to coerce or otherwise intercept data about ourselves, since we’re, as Galloway notes, giving it away in likes and clicks. Participation is voluntary and universal. 

While Blas’s mask is compelling and provocative, though, I suspect that it will maintain its status as art far better than as an incitement to action against a system that practically everyone is happy to participate in, regardless of conwequences.

Something else I found compelling in “Networks” was what Galloway refers to as the “third ramification” “for a critical theory of the networked form” (291). He suggests that software “privilege[s] surface over source,” meaning that source code occupies a lower hierarchical position than the experience of the user of the software in spite of the fact that “the executable is merely the result of a machinic compilation of the source code, which is the essential recipe or score for the realized work.” In the following paragraph, Galloway notes that “There is a design approach in computer science known as encapsulation, whereby code is segregated into modular units, sometimes called objects or libraries, with which one interacts via interfaces” (292). I’m wondering whether what he’s talking about here is something like the p5.js library that we’ve been calling on when we’re writing our JavaScript.

I mean, let’s pretend for a second that I can actually write JavaScript. I’m writing the source code for this game that features a keyed-up ball eating up twenty-odd bouncing balls. That makes me, in Haraway’s terms, the “master.” I created the source code. However, if what Galloway says is true, the person who actually plays the game (probably my daughter for about five minutes before she goes back to playing Minecraft) is privileged over my code. But now, according to Galloway, it’s not even *my* code, since I’m using stuff from some vast, invisible p5.js library. Now I’m the master of nothing – just the middleman, as it were.

So I’m trying to reconcile this simultaneous anonymity/exposure with “Fag Face” and what Galloway calls “The paradox of networked relations,” that, “the networked other is always obscured, but experiencing the essence of the other, even in its obscurity” (292). 

So I’ll leave this with a question: is it possible to be obscured or anonymous and exposed and known at the same time?
