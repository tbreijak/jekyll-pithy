Of the few people who have posted this week’s coding section of their blogs so far, both [Joe](joetorok.github.io/) and [David](davidlnowak.github.io/) have weighed in on how they feel about the new, slower-paced coding workload for the semester. While they both expressed ambivalence about it – liking the extra time but not sure whether the change’ll be beneficial, I can assure you that I have yet to exhale my enormous sigh of relief.

I’m fairly certain that I’m slightly behind the rest of the class in terms of coding and finishing the dailies, but I think I’m catching up. It didn’t help that I fucked something up (I have no idea what or how) and couldn’t sync anything because of a “merge conflict.” Thankfully, David, in his magnanimous magnificence, was able to work it out for me and let me get back to the frustration.

I was trying to code the ball to bounce both ways at once and succeeded in getting it to bounce on a diagonal, and David helped me figure out what was wrong. He pretty much showed me the right code, but I understood what I had done wrong and I feel like that was the important thing.

A big part of my problem is that I feel like I’m following along in class, and everything makes sense then but, when I get home, I’ve forgotten everything and I sit and stare at Atom, like Jack Torrance at his typewriter, thinking, “Oh, you evil motherfucker…”

That’s a reference to *The Shining*, for those of you who were wondering.

Anyway, I’ve been watching the “coding muppet” on Youtube, and he’s been very helpful. Also, I have to say that David and Scott have graciously donated their time and I think that, if I continue to be diligent I just might pass this class.
